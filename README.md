# Deno Icon File Server

This is a simple file server written in TypeScript, powered by Deno, which provides access to SVG assets contained within a static directory.

## Installation

You must have Deno installed to run this project. See [their official docs for up-to-date instructions on setting up Deno](https://deno.com/manual@v1.34.2/getting_started/installation).

To install Deno on macOS and Linux, run:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://deno.land/x/install/install.sh | sh
```

## Usage

To start this server once cloned, simply run:

```bash
deno task dev
```

## Tips

I recommend you optimize SVGs with SVG Optimizer (CLI) or [SVGOMG](https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/) (GUI).
